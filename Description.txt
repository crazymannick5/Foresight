This project centers on designing and implementing a
 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict stock 
 price fluctuations, blending machine learning 
 techniques with financial data analysis. The core 
 objective is to create a reliable framework that 
 processes raw stock market data, performs essential 
 preprocessing steps such as handling missing values 
 and normalization, and feeds the data into an RNN 
 architecture to capture temporal dependencies. By 
 utilizing daily time steps and a modular design, 
 the project aims to build a scalable and adaptable 
 solution for time-series forecasting.

The project emphasizes a systematic approach to neural
network development, starting with raw data handling 
and extending to forward and backward propagation
implementations. With features like configurable 
initialization methods, customizable loss and
activation functions, and a focus on building 
reusable components, the project demonstrates a deep 
understanding of RNN mechanics and their application to 
real-world datasets. This initiative highlights 
expertise in both programming and financial modeling, 
offering a practical and innovative tool for tackling 
complex prediction problems in quantitative finance.
